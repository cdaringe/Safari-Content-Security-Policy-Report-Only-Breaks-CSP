# CSP Tester

## Problem

`Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` interferes with `Content-Security-Policy`'s behavior, breaking sites using the ReportOnly header.

## Usage

```sh
npm install
npm run start
```

Then go to the URL that appears in your console and open your dev tools console to see the errors.
